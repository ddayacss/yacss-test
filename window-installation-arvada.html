Even decking materials that are structurally sound are still old, and you may have to replace them anyway in just a few years."

"Keywords": ["undefined"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Painting your deck is a great way to bring vibrant color to your outdoor living area. Typically, homeowners paint railings, stairs, and posts but stain the decking. That&#39;s because stain tends to hold up better to foot traffic than paint. Nevertheless, painting decking boards is definitely possible."

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, as long as the old deck paint is still in good condition, you should be able to paint right over it. But if the old paint is cracking, peeling, or otherwise damaged, give it a light sanding to even the surface before you paint. Nov 16, 2022"
